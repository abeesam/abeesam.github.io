This is a read me file
 
 I used HTML to make a picture slideshow, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to provide functionality.

I organised the slideshow in HTML using a container and distinct slide elements.
It was visually beautiful thanks to the use of CSS styling.
The navigation was handled by JavaScript, and slide visibility was managed by it.
The current slide was recorded in a variable that was created.
When users click the 'next' or 'previous' buttons, functions were developed to increase and decrease the current slide number.
Another functionÂ was created to ensure that the slideshow displays the correct slide as users navigate by updating the visibility of the slides based on the current slide number.
There were no external libraries utilised, and code comments made the code easier to read.

Form validation homework:
I used JavaScript to implement real-time validation for the form registration.
the Username, Email, Password, and Confirm Password sections on the HTML form.
Below each input, elements displaying error messages were presented.
If the validation conditions were not satisfied, form submission was blocked.
Non-emptiness, email format, password length, and password match were among the validation criteria.
As fields lost focus, real-time validation was carried out, providing visible feedback.
Both jobs were neatly submitted with organised files that complied with evaluation standards, guaranteeing proper data entry and working web components.
